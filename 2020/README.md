# Advent of code 2020
This year I'm committed to get only the first star for each level, 
unless a level requires the second star of a previous level.

Feel free to open an issue if you have questions, comments or suggestions :) 

## Bootstrap new day files
Use `new-day.sh <day>` to create needed files for working on a new day (I'm lazyâ„¢)
