# 2023
For this year, my goals are:

1. solving at least part 1 every day
2. use a different language almost every day.
3. write the least amount of code to solve the problems.

## Solutions
1. For day 1 I've implemented a simple programming language called "Bina" and wrote a program to solve day 1 part 1: https://github.com/FedericoPonzi/bina/blob/main/day1.bina
2. Zig
