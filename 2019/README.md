## 2019
Hello, World! While I had joined the past few editions, this year I've decided to publish my code on a public repo.

Since I've been using rust for the last few weeks now, I've decided to go ahead and try to solve the problems using this amazing new language.

All the code comes with unit testing, which can be run using:

```shell
cargo test day_4 # to test day 4
cargo test # to run all the tests
```

To run the code of a specific day, you will need to update the main to call the right `solution` and the right input file from the `inputs` directory (if required).

Since I'm doing this for improving my Rust, I'm not trying to make the solutions efficient when is not really needed (for instance, I'm reading the whole input file into a string).

Please, feel free to open an issue if you have comments or suggestion on the code! :)
